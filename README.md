# [Official] Comparing Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Mean Squared Error Loss in Knowledge Distillation

This repository is the official implementation of "Comparing Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Mean Squared Error Loss in Knowledge Distillation" paper presented in IJCAI 2021. Thanks to the contributors. [[IJCAI2021Poster](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0362.pdf)]

## Results

You can reproduce all results in the paper with our code. All results have been described in our paper including Appendix. The results of our experiments are so numerous that it is difficult to post everything here. However, if you experiment several times by modifying the hyperparameter value in the .sh file, you will be able to reproduce all of our analysis.
